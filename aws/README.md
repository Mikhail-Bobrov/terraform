To get started and deploy modules, you need to create a project in the Project folder (you can simply copy the project - test project)
add your deployment keys to the teraform.tfvars file and select all the necessary parameters, such as networks, etc.

also can be deployed as terraform plan\apply -target=module.${nameModule}

manual its just same code but without modules 
modules have been created from manual folder
